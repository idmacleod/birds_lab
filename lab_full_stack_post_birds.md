# Lab: Full Stack Application POST Request

**Lab Duration: 90 minutes**

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the data flow through a full stack application
- Be able to make a post request from a front-end application and persist the data in a database

## Introduction

You have been given an existing application that allows bird watchers to keep a record the species, dates and locations of bird sightings. The functionality that allows the user to save their sighting is not yet complete. Your task is to complete it.

## Task

### MVP

- Implement the functionality that allows a users to submit the form and for their bird sighting to be persisted so they can view their sightings at a late date. The webpage should display a list of all the saved bird sightings.

### Extension

- Implement the functionality that allows the user to delete a sighting.

## Planning

Identify which files in the application you are going to need to modify and how you are going to test each modification as you go. As a general rule of thumb, read your error messages - it may not be the case that everything you need to begin is actually there.
